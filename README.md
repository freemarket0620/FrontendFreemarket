# PiLab ESP32-P4 PLC (Alpha)

Experimental ESP32-P4 PLC/HMI platform with an embedded Vue.js SPA, AngelScript runtime, browser-based programming, file manager, tag registry, and web HMI.

---

# What is this?

PiLab is an experimental PLC-style automation platform running directly on the ESP32-P4.

The system combines:

- Real-time PLC scan loop
- AngelScript runtime for machine logic
- Browser-based code editor
- Embedded Vue.js single-page web application
- HMI designer/runtime
- Tag registry
- File manager using LittleFS
- REST API for live PLC data
- Fully self-hosted web interface on the ESP32-P4

The goal is to create a lightweight, modern, browser-first automation platform without requiring heavy desktop software or proprietary tooling.

# Example PLC / Edge Scripts

## Analog Signal Processing + Heartbeat

Example script showing:

- cyclic PLC scan logic
- array usage
- floating point math
- string handling
- edge-style sensor processing

```cpp
array<float> samples;
uint counter = 0;

void scan()
{
    samples.resize(32);

    float average = 0.0f;

    for (uint i = 0; i < samples.length(); i++)
    {
        float phase = float((counter + i) % 628) * 0.01f;

        samples[i] = 50.0f + sin(phase) * 10.0f;

        average += samples[i];
    }

    average /= samples.length();

    string status = "RUNNING";

    if (average > 55.0f)
        status = "HIGH";

    if (average < 45.0f)
        status = "LOW";

    // Example PLC outputs
    Q0 = average > 52.0f;
    Q1 = average < 48.0f;

    counter++;
}
```

## Simple Edge Vibration Monitor

Example script simulating vibration monitoring and alarm detection.

```cpp
array<float> vibration;
float rms = 0.0f;
bool alarm = false;

void scan()
{
    vibration.resize(64);

    float acc = 0.0f;

    for (uint i = 0; i < vibration.length(); i++)
    {
        float noise =
            sin(float(i) * 0.21f) * 2.0f +
            cos(float(i) * 0.07f) * 1.5f;

        vibration[i] = noise;

        acc += vibration[i] * vibration[i];
    }

    rms = sqrt(acc / vibration.length());

    // Alarm threshold
    alarm = rms > 2.2f;

    // PLC outputs
    Q0 = alarm;
    Q1 = !alarm;
}
```


## PLC-Style Timer Logic (TON)

Example showing IEC-style PLC timer logic implemented directly in AngelScript.

```cpp
class TON
{
    uint preset_ms;
    uint elapsed_ms;

    bool input;
    bool output;

    TON(uint preset)
    {
        preset_ms = preset;
        elapsed_ms = 0;
        input = false;
        output = false;
    }

    void update(bool in, uint scan_ms)
    {
        input = in;

        if (input)
        {
            if (elapsed_ms < preset_ms)
                elapsed_ms += scan_ms;

            if (elapsed_ms >= preset_ms)
                output = true;
        }
        else
        {
            elapsed_ms = 0;
            output = false;
        }
    }

    bool Q()
    {
        return output;
    }

    uint ET()
    {
        return elapsed_ms;
    }
};

TON motorStartDelay(2000);

void scan()
{
    // Start motor 2 seconds after input turns on
    motorStartDelay.update(I0, 5);

    Q0 = motorStartDelay.Q();
}
```

## Rising Edge Trigger + Alarm Latch

Example showing PLC-style edge detection and alarm latching.

```cpp
class RisingEdge
{
    bool last = false;

    bool update(bool input)
    {
        bool edge = input && !last;
        last = input;
        return edge;
    }
};

class AlarmLatch
{
    bool latched = false;

    void trigger()
    {
        latched = true;
    }

    void reset()
    {
        latched = false;
    }

    bool active()
    {
        return latched;
    }
};

RisingEdge startEdge;
AlarmLatch alarm;

void scan()
{
    // Detect rising edge
    if (startEdge.update(I0))
    {
        Q0 = true;
    }

    // Example alarm condition
    if (AI0 > 85.0f)
    {
        alarm.trigger();
    }

    // Reset alarm
    if (I1)
    {
        alarm.reset();
    }

    Q1 = alarm.active();
}
```

# Development Approach

This project was developed using a combination of:

- Traditional engineering and debugging
- Iterative prototyping
- AI-assisted development workflows

AI tools were used as engineering copilots to accelerate:
- boilerplate generation
- refactoring
- debugging
- UI migration
- documentation
- architecture exploration

All integration, testing, hardware validation, timing analysis, and final design decisions were performed manually during development.

The goal of the project is not only to explore embedded PLC/HMI architecture, but also modern AI-assisted engineering workflows.

One of the specific interests for this project is using LLM's to generate and debug machine logic.  This is much more difficult with vendor PLC's and HMI because of the closed binary systems.

```

The production output will be generated in:

```text
dist/
```

Current build output:

```text
dist/index.html
dist/assets/index.css
dist/assets/app.js
```

---

# Embedding the Vue App Into Firmware

Copy the built Vue files into the ESP-IDF project:

```text
firmware/P4_PLC_Base/main/web/
```

Result:

```text
main/web/index.html
main/web/assets/index.css
main/web/assets/app.js
